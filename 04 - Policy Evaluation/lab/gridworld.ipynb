    "Create the environment from the Russell and Norvig’s book on AI: **the Gridworld**. This environment is a 3 x 4 grid world in which the agent starts at the bottom-left corner, and it has to reach the top-right corner. There is a hole south of the goal and a wall near the start. The transition function has a 20% noise; that is, 80% the action succeeds, and 20% it fails uniformly at random in orthogonal directions. The reward function is a –0.04 living penalty, a +1 for landing on the goal, and a –1 for landing on the hole.\n",
